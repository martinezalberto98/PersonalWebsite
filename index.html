    <p id="intro-paragraph">My name is Alberto Martinez and I am a first-generation American, born and raised in Maryland to parents who immigrated from El Salvador. 
      I graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in software development. 
      Originally, I wanted to become a math teacher, but as I learned more about the education industry, I recognized that my skills were better suited for a different path. 
      I have a strong passion for software development because I enjoy computers, learning new frameworks/programming languages, and transferable skills I could bring in such as problem solving, collaboration, and being detail orientated.
