        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My name is Alberto Martinez and I am a first-generation American, whose parents immigrated from El Salvador. 
            I am a student at University of Maryland with a degree in software development. 
            Originally, I wanted to become a math teacher, but as I learned more about the education industry, I recognized that my skills were better suited for a different path. 
            The challenges of teaching a large class with limited tools and resources made me reconsider, eventually leading me to pursue a career in software development. 
            I have a strong passion for software development because I enjoy computers, learning new frameworks/programming languages.

        <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Maryland, whose parents immigrated here from El Salvador. My parents came here in the mid 80’s because of a civil war that caused hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans to immigrate. 
            My mom had quite a journey when arriving here. She came through Ciudad Juarez and crossed through El Paso, Texas. Once she arrived to El Paso, she bought a flight to Los Angeles, CA and started cleaning houses. 
            At the time, Los Angeles did not have many jobs, as my mom was cleaning houses and selling pupusas. However, she had a friend who was living in Northern Virginia at the time. This friend of my mother gave her a call, talked about the jobs in the DC Metropolitan area. 
            She even offered to split a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment with my mother. My mom made the move from Los Angeles, CA to Northern Virginia. When my mom moved to Northern Virginia, she found my father on a construction site. My mother, who had already been marred once and told herself she was not trying to get married again. 
            My father, in the same boat as my mother, had already been married 4 times. My father had a similar journey to my mom. The civil war in El Salvador, which started in 1979 and ended in 1992. My parents dated for a while, then decided to have me and my brother Marvin. We grew up together in Gaithersburg, MD where I lived my entire life. 
            Recently, I moved to San Diego, CA to chase new opportunities.

        <h2>Referee Life</h2>
        <p>In 2019, I found myself immersed in a routine of weekend outings—a lifestyle that didn't resonate with me. 
            Throughout my life, soccer had been my constant, occupying my time during both weekdays and weekends. 
            Then, one fateful day, a neighborhood friend approached me, asking if I could step in as a referee for his game. 
            Despite never having held a whistle before, I accepted the challenge after he outlined the roles and responsibilities involved. 
            As I officiated that game, receiving cash payment for the first time, an unexpected sense of fulfillment washed over me. 
            It felt like I was making a tangible contribution to the community I deeply belonged to. Motivated by this experience, I promptly enrolled in a referee class and obtained my referee badge. 
            From that moment on, there was no looking back. Over the past five years, I've journeyed across the country, from Kansas and Florida to Texas, California, and Nevada, among other places. 
            This role bestowed upon me a fresh perspective on the game I love. Officiating instilled in me a newfound sense of responsibility, collaboration, and attention to detail—a transformation I am profoundly grateful for.

        <h2>Interests/Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Besides my love for IT, tech, and officiating, I enjoy traveling, cooking, and hitting the gym. Something special about me is that I love traveling solo. While it might scare some people, I find it really relaxing.

            When you travel alone, you're in charge. You can eat what you want, see the sights you want, and do whatever activities you like. For my 21st birthday in 2019, I went to Europe alone and visited Spain, England, and France. I got to catch up with friends, go to soccer games, try amazing food, and see famous landmarks.
            
            Growing up in a Salvadoran family, I've always eaten homemade ethnic dishes because they're way better than eating out. One day, I had a terrible dinner at a friend's house, and I cried to my mom about it. That's when she taught me how to cook. At first, I didn't even know how to use a knife! But over time, I learned how to cook basic American dishes like pasta, burgers, and chicken.
            
            But I didn't want to lose my Salvadoran roots, so I kept learning. Now, I can make all sorts of Latin dishes. While I'm not a professional chef, I can cook really well for myself and my friends. They're always amazed at how good the food tastes.
